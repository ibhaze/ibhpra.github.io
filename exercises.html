                    We were given an exercise to change a bad UX into a good UX for an app or website. For this
                    exercise, I chose the Afval app (Trash collection app) because the spacing between the buttons isn't
                    consistent, and everything looks cluttered. So, I began the improvement process by maintaining the
                    basic idea/logic of the developers, which was to use green as the main color of the website. I
                    relocated the navigation to the bottom of the page because it was too close to the content. I also
                    had to make a good ui bad and I chose Google for that exercise . Check out the changes I made <a

                    In a UCD class, we were tasked with creating a brand based on a given word. Our concept involved
                    developing an application where users could compare prices and quality of goods from different shops
                    conveniently from their homes. We named this brand "Discount Digest" because our focus was on
                    providing affordable options to users. We brainstormed various food-related words and settled on
                    "digest" to represent the concept of gathering information. "Discount" was chosen to reflect the
                    app's purpose of offering cheaper alternatives.

                    We began by jotting down food-related words and listing the positives and negatives associated with
                    food. Then, through brainstorming sessions, we generated different ideas. Following this, we crafted
                    a user story to illustrate the necessity and usage of our app. Subsequently, we sought feedback.

                    The feedback we received highlighted the importance of incentivizing shops to participate,
                    considering the challenge of convincing them to compete. Additionally, a suggestion was made to
                    explore a model akin to Uber, where drivers are hired to collect items from various shops based on
                    pricing. </p>

            <div class="allgrid-6">
                <p> We got introduced to the node js environment with a little tutorial where we would install node js
                    and execute a code that will produce a joke
                    when you enter certain input , you can find the js code <a href="js/index.js">here</a>

            <div class="allgrid-8">
                <p> 
                    We were assigned the task of devising a passion project centered on areas we believed could be enhanced, and I brainstormed various ideas.
                    
                    One concept I developed is a Community Connection Platform for Students. This platform aims to facilitate social interaction and resource sharing among college students. Its primary target audience is university students aged 18-25 who seek to connect with peers within or outside their field, find mentorship, and access academic and career resources. Essentially, it provides a space for students to connect with individuals who have traversed similar paths, thus addressing common feelings of anxiety, isolation, stress, and academic pressure experienced by students. By fostering a sense of belonging, community, and collaboration, it enhances the overall university experience.
                    
                    The platform can be accessed via smartphones or computers, serving as a virtual hub for students to connect and engage. Users can join interest-based groups, such as their course group, participate in discussions and events, seek advice from fellow students or mentors, and access resources like study guides, internship opportunities, and mental health support services. Through these functionalities, the platform strives to create a supportive environment conducive to personal and academic growth.</p>
