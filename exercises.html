                    For an exercise aimed at transforming a poor user experience (UX) into a good one, I selected the Afval app (Trash collection app) due to inconsistencies in button spacing and a cluttered appearance. Maintaining the developers' core concept of using green as the primary color, I initiated the improvement process by repositioning the navigation to the bottom of the page, thereby enhancing clarity and user accessibility. As part of the exercise, I also had to reverse-engineer a good user interface (UI) into a bad one, for which I chose Google, demonstrating my ability to critically analyze and evaluate design choices (LO1). Through this exercise, I showcased my understanding of UX principles and my capacity to apply them in practical scenarios (LO1).. Check out the changes I made <a

                    In a User-Centered Design (UCD) class, our assignment was to create a brand based on a given word. Our concept centered around developing an application named "Discount Digest," where users could conveniently compare prices and quality of goods from different shops. We chose the name "Discount Digest" to reflect our focus on affordability and gathering information. "Digest" symbolized the concept of collecting information, while "Discount" emphasized the app's purpose of offering cheaper alternatives.

                    Our process began with brainstorming food-related words and analyzing their associations. We then generated various ideas and crafted a user story to illustrate the app's necessity and usage, aligning with Learning Outcome (LO1)  by conceptualizing and developing interactive media products. Seeking feedback, we received valuable insights emphasizing the need to incentivize shop participation and explore innovative models, akin to Uber, for efficient item collection from various shops based on pricing.
                    
                    Through this project, we demonstrated proficiency in user-centered design principles (LO1) and the ability to iterate creatively (LO3), incorporating stakeholder feedback to refine our concept. Additionally, we exhibited professionalism (LO4) by considering practical challenges and exploring sustainable business models. </p>

                    In our introduction to the Node.js environment, we embarked on a tutorial aimed at familiarizing ourselves with Node.js. Through this tutorial, we installed Node.js and executed code that generated jokes based on certain inputs. This exercise allowed us to explore the capabilities of Node.js and gain hands-on experience with server-side JavaScript programming. By engaging in this tutorial, we demonstrated our ability to work within the Node.js environment and execute JavaScript code for practical applications. This aligns with Learning Outcome (LO1)  by expanding our skills in developing interactive media products and exploring emerging technologies.you can find the js code <a href="js/index.js" target="_blank">here</a>

                    In response to an assignment task focused on devising a passion project, I brainstormed ideas and developed a concept for a Community Connection Platform for Students. This platform aims to enhance social interaction and resource sharing among college students, catering primarily to university students aged 18-25. Its purpose is to facilitate connections with peers within or outside their field, provide mentorship opportunities, and offer access to academic and career resources.

                    The platform addresses common challenges faced by students, such as anxiety, isolation, stress, and academic pressure, by fostering a sense of belonging, community, and collaboration. It serves as a virtual hub accessible via smartphones or computers, allowing students to join interest-based groups, participate in discussions and events, seek advice from peers or mentors, and access resources like study guides, internship opportunities, and mental health support services.
                    
                    Through these functionalities, the platform aims to create a supportive environment conducive to personal and academic growth. This project showcases my ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products (LO1) while addressing relevant ethical, intercultural, and sustainable aspects (LO4). Additionally, it reflects my awareness of personal strengths and weaknesses, as well as my commitment to promoting personal growth and learning (LO5).
