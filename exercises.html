                    At the beginning of the semester, we had a project where we had to fix a bad user experience (UX)
                    and make it better. I chose to work on the Afval app (Trash Collection app) because it had some
                    problems like buttons being too close together and the screen looking messy. To make it easier for
                    people to use, I decided to move the main menu to the bottom of the screen. This made things clearer
                    and simpler for users. I also changed the contrast and font style and size because the previous
                    choice was really hard
                    to look at .

                    In another part of the project, we had to make a good user interface (UI) look bad. I picked Google
                    for this because it's known for having a really clean and easy-to-use design. It was tough to mess
                    up something that's already so good, but I tried my best. By doing this, I showed that I understand
                    how to create, analyze and change designs, which is what learning outcome 1 is all about (LO1).

                    This project helped me learn a lot about how to make digital products easier to use and how to think
                    about design in a smart way. If you want to see the changes I made, take a look<a

                    In a User-Centered Design (UCD) class, I had to create a brand based on a given word , I given the
                    word "Food". I decided to
                    create an app called "Discount Digest", where people could compare prices and quality from different
                    stores. I picked the name because it shows my focus on finding good deals and gathering
                    information. "Digest" means collecting information, while "Discount" shows that the app helps people
                    find cheaper stuff.

                    I started by thinking of food-related words and what they mean. Then, I came up with lots of ideas
                    and wrote a story to explain why the app is useful. This matches Learning Outcome 1 (LO1) because I
                    came up with ideas for a digital product and made it real.

                    To make our app better, I asked for feedback from my classmates and they told me I should find ways
                    to get stores to
                    join the app and think about new ways to collect items from different stores . After their feedback
                    , I worked on improving the branding and I had an idea to have an uber like system for the delivery
                    where the drivers closest to the users take their orders and go to the most affordable shop to get
                    the order.

                    This project showed that I understand how to design things with users in mind and how to come
                    up with new ideas . I also showed professionalism by thinking about real-world problems
                    and finding ways to make my idea work for everyone.

                    In my introduction to the Node.js environment, I embarked on a tutorial aimed at familiarizing
                    Myself with Node.js . Through this tutorial, I installed Node.js and executed code that
                    generated
                    jokes based on certain inputs. This exercise allowed me to explore the capabilities of Node.js and
                    gain hands-on experience with server-side JavaScript programming. By engaging in this tutorial, I
                    demonstrated my ability to work within the Node.js environment and execute JavaScript code for
                    practical applications. This aligns with Learning Outcome (LO1) by expanding my skills in
                    developing interactive media products and exploring emerging technologies. You can find the js code

                <p>
                    For a class project, we were asked to come up with a passion project. I spent some time
                    brainstorming ideas until I landed on something I truly cared about: a Community Connection Platform
                    for Students. I envisioned a space where college students, aged 18-25, could come together, share
                    resources, and support one another.

                    The idea behind this platform was simple yet powerful. I wanted to address common challenges faced
                    by students, such as stress, isolation, and academic pressure, by creating a sense of belonging and
                    community. So, I set out to develop a virtual hub accessible via smartphones or computers, where
                    students could connect with peers, join interest-based groups, and access various resources—from
                    study guides to mental health support services.

                    As I worked on this project, I realized it wasn't just about creating a platform; it was about
                    creating an environment for personal and academic growth. I wanted students to feel empowered,
                    supported, and encouraged to reach their full potential. To start the project , I spent time
                    observing students in various settings—libraries, cafeterias, and study groups.
                    This allowed me to observe their interactions, communication patterns, and technological preferences
                    firsthand. I found out that most students exhibited a high reliance on smartphones . They frequently
                    checked their devices for messages, social media updates, and academic resources. I also
                    noticed that a lot of students practiced eye-blocking which is very common in people who have social
                    anxiety . This was how this project started .

                    Through this journey, I demonstrated my ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media
                    products (LO1). But it wasn't just about the technical aspects; I also considered important factors
                    like ethics, culture, and sustainability (LO4). Moreover, this project highlighted my commitment to
                    self-awareness and continuous learning (LO5), as I strived to understand my strengths and weaknesses
                    while working towards a common goal: making a positive impact on student communities.

                <p>I got introduced to React JS with a reader that required me to follow steps to create a react app and
                    I ran into a couple of problems while doing so .In the end I was able to find solutions to the
                    problems
                    using chatGPT and other resources . I even had to create a couple of files including an AddPost file

                    We were given an assignment to create a pov/how might we document to see how we approach our
                    research
                    and for this assignment , I started out by doing some primary research and finding out what a POV
                    document should display , then I created a pov for my passion project to see through the eyes of the
                    user .I asked for
                    feedback from Penny and she gave me some improvement points in the pov and told me not to be
                    too specific and to have a clear definition on what the users will be doing in the scenarios , I
                    applied her feedback
                    and improved upon my previous iteration. In my second Iteration you can see that each scenario is
                    less specific , after the second iteration I went back to Penny and she liked the fact that I
                    created more
                    POV's and also improved through her feedback .

                    <a href="documents/HOW MIGHT WE .pdf">here</a>. In this exercise I believe I showcased my
                    proficiency in LO3 by asking for feedback and creating another iteration
                    and also LO4 because i applied a part of the double diamond research method by doing some research
                    on what a POV doocunent must have .

                    During our recent API workshop, I was assigned to create a library API with guidance. I was
                    excited to get started but hit a roadblock early on: a 'cannot Get' error. After some research, I
                    realized I hadn't defined a route for the root endpoint. It was frustrating, and I spent a lot of
                    time trying to fix it. This made me realize I needed to improve my problem-solving skills. I often
                    spend too much time on problems without finding a solution, wasting valuable time. This experience
                    taught me to approach challenges more efficiently by asking the right questions during research .
                    After a long time struggling with it I was able to finally get the solution .I displayed my
                    proficiency in Learning Outcome

                <p>Becoming a UX designer is my goal, and Penny's lectures have really helped me understand the field.
                    In
                    one
                    class, Penny gave us an exercise to create a prototype for a webshop's favorite page and map out how
                    users
                    would navigate it. This exercise taught me a lot.

                    As I worked on the prototype, I learned about user flows and why it's important to think about
                    different
                    scenarios, even the negative ones. In the first try, I missed a page in the flow. Penny told me to
                    think
                    about situations where users might only want to checkout with one item from the favorite page. So, I
                    added
                    checkboxes for each item, making it possible for users to checkout with just one item.

                    I kept asking for feedback, and Penny suggested I make the link between the favorite and checkout
                    pages
                    clearer. So, I added a confirmation pop-up to bridge the gap between the two pages, making it easier
                    for
                    users to navigate.

                    In Penny's class, I also learned about the multi-modal wizard. I wanted to use it for my project,
                    but my
                    teammates weren't on board. Despite this, I showed my ability to create design media products by
                    making
                    a
                    low-fidelity prototype displaying my proficiency in learning outcome 1 . I also showed I could take
                    feedback and make changes, which is important for
                    learning , displaying my proficiency in learning outcome 3.

                    This whole experience has taught me a lot and helped me grow as a designer. Penny's guidance and the
                    supportive class environment have been really valuable.
