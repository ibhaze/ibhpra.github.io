                    We were given an exercise to change a bad UX into a good UX for an app or website. For this
                    exercise, I chose the Afval app (Trash collection app) because the spacing between the buttons isn't
                    consistent, and everything looks cluttered. So, I began the improvement process by maintaining the
                    basic idea/logic of the developers, which was to use green as the main color of the website. I
                    relocated the navigation to the bottom of the page because it was too close to the content. I also
                    had to make a good ui bad and I chose Google for that exercise . Check out the changes I made <a

                    In a UCD class, we were tasked with creating a brand based on a given word. Our concept involved
                    developing an application where users could compare prices and quality of goods from different shops
                    conveniently from their homes. We named this brand "Discount Digest" because our focus was on
                    providing affordable options to users. We brainstormed various food-related words and settled on
                    "digest" to represent the concept of gathering information. "Discount" was chosen to reflect the
                    app's purpose of offering cheaper alternatives.

                    We began by jotting down food-related words and listing the positives and negatives associated with
                    food. Then, through brainstorming sessions, we generated different ideas. Following this, we crafted
                    a user story to illustrate the necessity and usage of our app. Subsequently, we sought feedback.

                    The feedback we received highlighted the importance of incentivizing shops to participate,
                    considering the challenge of convincing them to compete. Additionally, a suggestion was made to
                    explore a model akin to Uber, where drivers are hired to collect items from various shops based on
                    pricing. </p>

                <p> We got introduced to the node js environment with a little tutorial where we would install node js
