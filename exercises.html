                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the semester, we had a project where we had to fix a bad user experience (UX)
                    and make it better. I chose to work on the Afval app (Trash Collection app) because it had some
                    problems like buttons being too close together and the screen looking messy.
                </p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    To make it easier for people to use, I decided to move the main menu to the bottom of the screen.
                    This made things clearer and simpler for users. I also changed the contrast and font style and size
                    because the previous choice was really hard to look at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In another part of the project, we had to make a good user interface (UI) look bad. I picked Google
                    for this because it's known for having a really clean and easy-to-use design. It was tough to mess
                    up something that's already so good, but I tried my best. By doing this, I showed that I understand
                    how to create, analyze, and change designs, which is what learning outcome 1 is all about (LO1).
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project helped me learn a lot about how to make digital products easier to use and how to think
                    about design in a smart way. If you want to see the changes I made, take a look <a

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    In a User-Centered Design (UCD) class, I had to create a brand based on a given word. I was given
                    the word "Food". I decided to create an app called "Discount Digest", where people could compare
                    prices and quality from different stores. I picked the name because it shows my focus on finding
                    good deals and gathering information. "Digest" means collecting information, while "Discount" shows
                    that the app helps people find cheaper stuff.
                </p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    I started by thinking of food-related words and what they mean. Then, I came up with lots of ideas
                    and wrote a story to explain why the app is useful. This matches Learning Outcome 1 (LO1) because I
                    came up with ideas for a digital product and made it real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make our app better, I asked for feedback from my classmates, and they told me I should find ways
                    to get stores to join the app and think about new ways to collect items from different stores. After
                    their feedback, I worked on improving the branding and had an idea to have an Uber-like system for
                    the delivery where the drivers closest to the users take their orders and go to the most affordable
                    shop to get the order.
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    This project showed that I understand how to design things with users in mind and how to come up
                    with new ideas. I also showed professionalism by thinking about real-world problems and finding ways
                    to make my idea work for everyone.

                <p>
                    In my introduction to the Node.js environment, I embarked on a tutorial aimed at familiarizing
                    Myself with Node.js . Through this tutorial, I installed Node.js and executed code that
                    generated
                    jokes based on certain inputs. This exercise allowed me to explore the capabilities of Node.js and
                    gain hands-on experience with server-side JavaScript programming. By engaging in this tutorial, I
                    demonstrated my ability to work within the Node.js environment and execute JavaScript code for
                    practical applications. This aligns with Learning Outcome (LO1) by expanding my skills in
                    developing interactive media products and exploring emerging technologies. You can find the js code

                <h1 class="stroke-text">PASSION PROJECT</h1>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    For a class project, we were asked to come up with a passion project. I spent some time
                    brainstorming ideas until I landed on something I truly cared about: a Community Connection Platform
                    for Students. I envisioned a space where college students, aged 18-25, could come together, share
                    resources, and support one another.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this platform was simple yet powerful. I wanted to address common challenges faced
                    by students, such as stress, isolation, and academic pressure, by creating a sense of belonging and
                    community. So, I set out to develop a virtual hub accessible via smartphones or computers, where
                    students could connect with peers, join interest-based groups, and access various resources—from
                    study guides to mental health support services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I worked on this project, I realized it wasn't just about creating a platform; it was about
                    creating an environment for personal and academic growth. I wanted students to feel empowered,
                    supported, and encouraged to reach their full potential. To start the project, I spent time
                    observing students in various settings—libraries, cafeterias, and study groups. This allowed me to
                    observe their interactions, communication patterns, and technological preferences firsthand. I found
                    out that most students exhibited a high reliance on smartphones. They frequently checked their
                    devices for messages, social media updates, and academic resources. I also noticed that a lot of
                    students practiced eye-blocking, which is very common in people who have social anxiety. This was
                    how this project started.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Through this journey, I demonstrated my ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media
                    products (LO1). But it wasn't just about the technical aspects; I also considered important factors
                    like ethics, culture, and sustainability (LO4). Moreover, this project highlighted my commitment to
                    self-awareness and continuous learning (LO5), as I strived to understand my strengths and weaknesses
                    while working towards a common goal: making a positive impact on student communities.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    I got introduced to React JS with a reader that required me to follow steps to create a React app. I
                    aimed to learn the fundamentals of this popular JavaScript library to enhance my web development
                    skills.

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    During the process, I encountered a couple of problems. However, I was able to find solutions to
                    these issues using ChatGPT and other resources. I created several files, including an AddPost file,
                    and made necessary changes to the Add file. Check my <a href="readme.md" target="_blank">readme</a>

                    We were given an assignment to create a POV/How Might We document to demonstrate our approach to
                    research. For this assignment, I aimed to understand the essential elements of a POV document and
                    apply this knowledge to my passion project by seeing through the eyes of the user.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    I began by conducting primary research to learn what a POV document should display. I then created a
                    POV for my passion project to understand the user perspective. After completing my initial draft, I
                    sought feedback from Penny. She provided valuable suggestions, advising me to avoid being too
                    specific and to clearly define what users will be doing in the scenarios. I applied her feedback and
                    improved upon my previous iteration. In my second iteration, each scenario was less specific,
                    reflecting her advice. After presenting the revised document to Penny, she appreciated that I
                    created more POVs and showed improvement based on her feedback. You can find the document <a
                        href="documents/HOW MIGHT WE .pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    This exercise was instrumental in showcasing my proficiency in Learning Outcome 3 (LO3) by actively
                    seeking feedback and iterating on my work. Additionally, I demonstrated Learning Outcome 4 (LO4) by
                    applying a part of the Double Diamond research method through my research on the essential
                    components of a POV document. This project highlighted my ability to integrate feedback effectively,
                    improve my work iteratively, and employ research methodologies to enhance the quality of my outputs.
                    Overall, it reinforced the importance of user-centered design and the continuous refinement of ideas
                    to better meet user needs.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    During our recent API workshop, I was assigned to create a library API with guidance. I was
                    excited to get started but hit a roadblock early on: a 'cannot Get' error. After some research, I
                    realized I hadn't defined a route for the root endpoint. It was frustrating, and I spent a lot of
                    time trying to fix it. This made me realize I needed to improve my problem-solving skills. I often
                    spend too much time on problems without finding a solution, wasting valuable time. This experience
                    taught me to approach challenges more efficiently by asking the right questions during research.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    Becoming a UX designer is my goal, and Penny's lectures have really helped me understand the field.
                    In
                    one class, Penny gave us an exercise to create a prototype for a webshop's favorite page and map out
                    how
                    users would navigate it. This exercise taught me a lot.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    As I worked on the prototype, I learned about user flows and why it's important to think about
                    different
                    scenarios, even the negative ones. In the first try, I missed a page in the flow. Penny told me to
                    think
                    about situations where users might only want to checkout with one item from the favorite page. So, I
                    added
                    checkboxes for each item, making it possible for users to checkout with just one item.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kept asking for feedback, and Penny suggested I make the link between the favorite and checkout
                    pages clearer. So, I added a confirmation pop-up to bridge the gap between the two pages, making it
                    easier
                    for users to navigate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Penny's class, I also learned about the multi-modal wizard. I wanted to use it for my project,
                    but my teammates weren't on board. Despite this, I showed my ability to create design media products
                    by
                    making a low-fidelity prototype displaying my proficiency in learning outcome 1. I also showed I
                    could take
                    feedback and make changes, which is important for learning, displaying my proficiency in learning
                    outcome 3.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    This whole experience has taught me a lot and helped me grow as a designer. Penny's guidance and the
                    supportive class environment have been really valuable.
                </p>
