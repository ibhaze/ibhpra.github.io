                    For an exercise aimed at transforming a poor user experience (UX) into a good one, I selected the
                    Afval app (Trash collection app) due to inconsistencies in button spacing and a cluttered
                    appearance. Maintaining the developers' core concept of using green as the primary color, I
                    initiated the improvement process by repositioning the navigation to the bottom of the page, thereby
                    enhancing clarity and user accessibility. As part of the exercise, I also had to reverse-engineer a
                    good user interface (UI) into a bad one, for which I chose Google, demonstrating my ability to
                    critically analyze and evaluate design choices (LO1). Through this exercise, I showcased my
                    understanding of UX principles and my capacity to apply them in practical scenarios (LO1).. Check

                    In a User-Centered Design (UCD) class, our assignment was to create a brand based on a given word.
                    Our concept centered around developing an application named "Discount Digest," where users could
                    conveniently compare prices and quality of goods from different shops. We chose the name "Discount
                    Digest" to reflect our focus on affordability and gathering information. "Digest" symbolized the
                    concept of collecting information, while "Discount" emphasized the app's purpose of offering cheaper
                    alternatives.

                    Our process began with brainstorming food-related words and analyzing their associations. We then
                    generated various ideas and crafted a user story to illustrate the app's necessity and usage,
                    aligning with Learning Outcome (LO1) by conceptualizing and developing interactive media products.
                    Seeking feedback, we received valuable insights emphasizing the need to incentivize shop
                    participation and explore innovative models, akin to Uber, for efficient item collection from
                    various shops based on pricing.

                    Through this project, we demonstrated proficiency in user-centered design principles (LO1) and the
                    ability to iterate creatively (LO3), incorporating stakeholder feedback to refine our concept.
                    Additionally, we exhibited professionalism (LO4) by considering practical challenges and exploring
                    sustainable business models. </p>

                    In our introduction to the Node.js environment, we embarked on a tutorial aimed at familiarizing
                    ourselves with Node.js . Through this tutorial, we installed Node.js and executed code that generated
                    jokes based on certain inputs. This exercise allowed us to explore the capabilities of Node.js and
                    gain hands-on experience with server-side JavaScript programming. By engaging in this tutorial, we
                    demonstrated our ability to work within the Node.js environment and execute JavaScript code for
                    practical applications. This aligns with Learning Outcome (LO1) by expanding our skills in
                    developing interactive media products and exploring emerging technologies.you can find the js code

                <p>
                    In response to an assignment task focused on devising a passion project, I brainstormed ideas and
                    developed a concept for a Community Connection Platform for Students. This platform aims to enhance
                    social interaction and resource sharing among college students, catering primarily to university
                    students aged 18-25. Its purpose is to facilitate connections with peers within or outside their
                    field, provide mentorship opportunities, and offer access to academic and career resources.

                    The platform addresses common challenges faced by students, such as anxiety, isolation, stress, and
                    academic pressure, by fostering a sense of belonging, community, and collaboration. It serves as a
                    virtual hub accessible via smartphones or computers, allowing students to join interest-based
                    groups, participate in discussions and events, seek advice from peers or mentors, and access
                    resources like study guides, internship opportunities, and mental health support services.

                    Through these functionalities, the platform aims to create a supportive environment conducive to
                    personal and academic growth. This project showcases my ability to conceptualize and develop
                    interactive media products (LO1) while addressing relevant ethical, intercultural, and sustainable
                    aspects (LO4). Additionally, it reflects my awareness of personal strengths and weaknesses, as well
                    as my commitment to promoting personal growth and learning (LO5).

                I got introduced to React JS with a reader that required me to follow steps to create a react app and I ran into a couple of problems while doing so .In the end I was able to find solutions to the problems

                    We were given an assignment to create a pov/how might we document to see how we approach our
                    research
                    and for this assignment , I started out by doing some primary research and finding out what a POV
                    document should display , then I created a pov for my passion project to see through the eyes of the
                    user .I asked for
                    feedback from our teacher and she gave me some improvement points in the pov and told me not to be
                    too specific , I applied her feedback
                    and improved upon my previous iteration. You can find the document
                    <a href="documents/HOW MIGHT WE .pdf">here</a>. In this exercise I believe I showcased my
                    proficiency in LO3 by asking for feedback and creating another iteration
                    and also LO4 because i applied a part of the double diamond research method by doing some research
                    on what a POV doocunent must have .
