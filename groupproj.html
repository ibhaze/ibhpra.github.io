                    <p>
                        In the first week of the 3rd semester, we kicked off with an intro week,
                        forming groups and tackling various tasks. One task involved designing a
                        business card to represent ourselves. Research revealed that business cards
                        usually have these key elements: name/logo, contact info, and possibly
                        location and social media. My card incorporated these essentials in a
                        simple blue and white design initially. In the second iteration, I
                        experimented with black and gold for a touch of luxury and professionalism
                        . For the front, I created a temporary logo using the first letters of my
                        name, with a curved watermark outside for visual interest. Nova Cut font
                        was ideal, and an overlay box added uniqueness. The back used Garamond
                        for a professional look. A gold bookmark icon symbolizes my commitment
                        to organization, aiming to provide clients with streamlined processes
                        and easy access to valuable resources. <a href="documents/business card.pdf" target="_blank">see

                <h1 class="stroke-text">TRIPLE-S</h1>
                <p>
                    During the group formation, we decided on the name TRIPLE-s to signify our third semester and our
                    focus on strategic research, swift development, and stylish designs. Our initial step as a group was
                    to draft a contract agreement, outlining our agreed-upon rules. Following this, we delved into
                    brainstorming sessions to define our brand identity, starting with individual iterations of our
                    logo. My approach involved researching companies using the letter "s" in their logos, studying
                    fonts, shapes, and structures. After creating numerous iterations, we sought feedback on each
                    design. Ultimately, the version crafted by Danya resonated the most, leading us to refine variations
                    based on that design. Upon presenting our branding concept to fellow students, feedback favored the
                    final "fan-like" logo over other options. Some perceived the initial snake-themed logo as conveying
                    a pharmaceutical or deceptive vibe. Consequently, we chose to further enhance the fan-like logo,
                    resulting in our finalized logo design. You can view the iterations <a

                    After we designed the logo, our next step was defining our brand identity. We discussed what our
                    brand should represent and settled on the color purple. Then, we decided on the services we would
                    offer. I created visual representations of our branding three times. The first version was deemed
                    too professional after we sought feedback. So, I made a second iteration, which received positive
                    feedback but needed some tweaks. Upon personal reflection, I felt the visuals were too playful.
                    Hence, I created one more iteration to find a balance between professionalism and playfulness. You
                    can find the iterations <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/QFHKV2YdPIVMbycFyI06aL/Contract-agreement-group-1-sem-3?type=design&node-id=438%3A260&mode=design&t=9JNHi5zJNP1r2Iyd-1">here</a>

                <p>During this semester, our group prioritized using GitLab as it's a requirement. We started by
                    creating our repository once the group was formed. Then, we created individual branches for each
                    member to work on. You can access our Git repository <a href="https://git.fhict.nl/I461683/triple-s-work.git">here</a>.

                    For communication, we opted for Discord and WhatsApp as our main channels. Additionally, we chose
                    Trello to organize our tasks efficiently. Personally, I set up my personal Git repository to upload
                    my work for my portfolio. I ensured to comment my code. You can find my repository <a href="https://git.fhict.nl/I510304/ibhpra.git">here</a>
