                        "In the introductory week of the 3rd semester, our group tasks included designing personal
                        business cards. My approach involved iterative design processes, reflecting Learning Outcomes
                        (LO) 1, 3, and 5. Initially, I crafted a simple blue and white design, incorporating essential
                        elements like name/logo and contact information, demonstrating my ability to conceptualize and
                        develop interactive media products. Subsequently, I iterated on the design, experimenting with
                        black and gold for a touch of luxury and professionalism, showcasing creative iterations (LO3).
                        Throughout the process, I remained self-aware of my strengths and weaknesses, aligning my design
                        choices with personal values such as commitment to organization, symbolized by a gold bookmark
                        icon, thus displaying personal leadership qualities (LO5)." <a

                <p>
                    In the process of group formation, we named ourselves TRIPLE-s, signifying our third semester and
                    focus on strategic research, swift development, and stylish designs. We began by drafting a contract
                    agreement to establish our rules, demonstrating adherence to professional standards (LO4). Engaging
                    in collaborative brainstorming sessions, we collectively defined our brand identity, with each
                    member contributing logo iterations. My contribution involved thorough research on logos
                    incorporating the letter "s," showcasing my ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media
                    products (LO1). Iteratively refining our designs based on feedback, we adopted a logo crafted by
                    Danya, demonstrating our commitment to creative iterations (LO3). Feedback from peers favored a
                    fan-like logo over alternatives, leading us to refine and finalize our design, displaying personal
                    leadership (LO5) in aligning our branding choices with stakeholder preferences and ethical
                    considerations. You can view the iterations <a href="documents/Contract agreement group 1 sem 3.pdf"

                    Following the logo design phase, our focus shifted to defining our brand identity. We collectively
                    agreed that our brand should be represented by the color purple and determined the services we would
                    offer, showcasing our ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products (LO1). I took
                    the lead in creating visual representations of our branding, iterating three times to achieve the
                    desired balance between professionalism and playfulness, thereby demonstrating my commitment to
                    creative iterations (LO3). Initially, feedback deemed the first version too professional, prompting
                    adjustments for the second iteration, which received positive feedback but required further
                    refinement. Reflecting on the visuals, I recognized the need for a balance and created a third
                    iteration, aligning our branding choices with stakeholder preferences and professional standards
                    (LO4).You

                    I was also involved in the creation of our group website's prototype. We began by creating
                    wireframes to illustrate how we wanted our website to appear. The wireframe served as a guide for
                    the placement of buttons and text. We aimed for a gamified, tech-oriented website, which we
                    implemented in the high-fidelity prototype. Find the prototype <a

                <P>
                    Our project for the semester involved creating a personalized nutrition plan for users utilizing generative
                    AI. Our client, Livewall, is deeply immersed in the world of generative AI, presenting an excellent 
                    opportunity for me to enhance my skills in this domain. Using the double diamond method We initiated the project by conducting primary research on
                    user preferences in nutrition apps or websites and formulated a survey based on the findings. Our research
                    indicated that users primarily seek nutrition plans to maintain their health or achieve weight loss goals. Subsequently, I collaborated with Danya to refine the survey and targeted it towards our client's demographic, which comprises middle-aged individuals. Following this, we solicited feedback from our teacher, who suggested improvements to the survey. These included incorporating an introductory section to elucidate the concept of a nutrition plan for users and integrating a question addressing their personal preferences, such as weight loss or muscle gain.
                    .These are the <a href="documents/survey findings.pdf" target="_blank">results</a> .After multiple iterations of the survey , we created a <a href="documents/Concept Document.pdf" target="_blank">concept document</a> to serve as a guide for the 
                    primary and secondary research  , and I was again in charge of creating the POV /HMV to kind of serve as 
                    a way of viewing the product and users from a different perspective .After this , I created interview questions alongside danya to have more quality and useful insights , We refined the interview 
                    questions after asking for feedback and from the feedback we reflected and decided to split the questions into two sections ..You can find the interview questions and transcript <a href="documents/Interview questions .pdf"></a>.I also created the low fidelity prototype for the nutrition plan 
                    on my own so that we'd have a diffferent variation of the one we created together . Find the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Nv2aoMzsGZ2p8pHwbpCPJk/NUTRITION-PLAN-PROTOTYPE?type=design&node-id=29%3A2&mode=design&t=N2PZLIpOybsY2OpV-1" target="_blank">here</a>
                    In this section of my portfolio ,
                    I displayed my proficiency in LO3 by iterating and improving the survey based on the feedback I got from
                    the teacher and I displayed LO4 by conducting research to get to know more about the other nutrition apps
                    and websites and their components. I also displayed LO5 by creating my own version of the low-fidelity prototype
                    to give my group different options .I displayed my proficiency in LO1 by creating a low-fi prototype , using the double diamond method , creating the concept document and creating interview questions .

                <p>Throughout this semester, our group prioritized utilizing GitLab as it's a mandatory tool. After
                    forming our group, our first task was to establish our repository on GitLab. We meticulously
                    organized our workflow by creating individual branches for each member, facilitating efficient
                    collaboration and version control (LO2). Our Git repository can be accessed <a
                        href="https://git.fhict.nl/I461683/triple-s-work.git" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    In addition to GitLab, we utilized Discord and WhatsApp for communication and Trello for task
                    organization, demonstrating our ability to employ transferable production tools effectively. On a
                    personal level, I set up my personal Git repository to store my work for my portfolio, ensuring to
                    comment my code according to best practices (LO2). My repository can be found <a
                        href="https://git.fhict.nl/I510304/ibhpra.git" target="_blank">here</a>..

                    We also created a way to work together and give each other tasks daily or weekly depending on how we
                    wanted to go about it and we used trello and mirrorboard to colaborate
