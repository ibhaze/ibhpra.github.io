                        "In the introductory week of the 3rd semester, our group tasks included designing personal business cards. My approach involved iterative design processes, reflecting Learning Outcomes (LO) 1, 3, and 5. Initially, I crafted a simple blue and white design, incorporating essential elements like name/logo and contact information, demonstrating my ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products. Subsequently, I iterated on the design, experimenting with black and gold for a touch of luxury and professionalism, showcasing creative iterations (LO3). Throughout the process, I remained self-aware of my strengths and weaknesses, aligning my design choices with personal values such as commitment to organization, symbolized by a gold bookmark icon, thus displaying personal leadership qualities (LO5)." <a href="documents/business card.pdf" target="_blank">see cards</a>

                <p>
                    In the process of group formation, we named ourselves TRIPLE-s, signifying our third semester and focus on strategic research, swift development, and stylish designs. We began by drafting a contract agreement to establish our rules, demonstrating adherence to professional standards (LO4). Engaging in collaborative brainstorming sessions, we collectively defined our brand identity, with each member contributing logo iterations. My contribution involved thorough research on logos incorporating the letter "s," showcasing my ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products (LO1). Iteratively refining our designs based on feedback, we adopted a logo crafted by Danya, demonstrating our commitment to creative iterations (LO3). Feedback from peers favored a fan-like logo over alternatives, leading us to refine and finalize our design, displaying personal leadership (LO5) in aligning our branding choices with stakeholder preferences and ethical considerations.

                    Following the logo design phase, our focus shifted to defining our brand identity. We collectively agreed that our brand should be represented by the color purple and determined the services we would offer, showcasing our ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products (LO1). I took the lead in creating visual representations of our branding, iterating three times to achieve the desired balance between professionalism and playfulness, thereby demonstrating my commitment to creative iterations (LO3). Initially, feedback deemed the first version too professional, prompting adjustments for the second iteration, which received positive feedback but required further refinement. Reflecting on the visuals, I recognized the need for a balance and created a third iteration, aligning our branding choices with stakeholder preferences and professional standards (LO4).You

                    I was also involved in the creation of our group website's prototype. We began by creating wireframes to illustrate how we wanted our website to appear. The wireframe served as a guide for the placement of buttons and text. We aimed for a gamified, tech-oriented website, which we implemented in the high-fidelity prototype.

                <p>Throughout this semester, our group prioritized utilizing GitLab as it's a mandatory tool. After forming our group, our first task was to establish our repository on GitLab. We meticulously organized our workflow by creating individual branches for each member, facilitating efficient collaboration and version control (LO2). Our Git repository can be accessed <a href="https://git.fhict.nl/I461683/triple-s-work.git" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    In addition to GitLab, we utilized Discord and WhatsApp for communication and Trello for task organization, demonstrating our ability to employ transferable production tools effectively. On a personal level, I set up my personal Git repository to store my work for my portfolio, ensuring to comment my code according to best practices (LO2). My repository can be found <a href="https://git.fhict.nl/I510304/ibhpra.git" target="_blank">here</a>
