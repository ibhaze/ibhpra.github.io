                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    During the introductory week of the 3rd semester, our group had a fun task: designing personal
                    business cards. It was a chance to get creative and show off our design skills. For me, this project
                    was more than just making a card with my details. It was about learning and
                    showing what I could do.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>

                <p>
                    I started with a simple design in blue and white. It had my name, logo, and contact info. After
                    that, I asked for feedback from a teacher in semester 2, and he said I should make it represent
                    me. So, I started working on a different design with a black background. This design also
                    includes a bookmark icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose black, grey, and gold as my personal brand colors because they reflect my personality
                    and style. Black represents sophistication and elegance, while grey symbolizes professionalism
                    and neutrality. Gold signifies luxury and prestige. Together, these colors convey a sense of
                    sophistication and professionalism that aligns with my personal brand.
                    As for the bookmark icon, I incorporated it into the design to symbolize my commitment to
                    organization and efficiency. Just as a bookmark helps keep things organized in a book, I strive
                    to keep my work and projects well-structured and easily accessible. Therefore, the bookmark icon
                    serves as a visual representation of this aspect of my personality and work ethic.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    But I didn't stop there. I wanted to make my card look fancy, so I tried adding black and gold.
                    This showed I could make interactive things, which demonstrates proficiency in Learning Outcome 1.
                    In the end, my business card wasn't just a piece of paper. It was a way to show who I am as a
                    designer and what I've learned.

                <h1 class="stroke-text">TRIPLE-S</h1>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    During our group formation, we decided to call ourselves TRIPLE-S. This name represented us as
                    third-semester students and highlighted our focus on strategic research, quick development, and cool
                    designs. To start off, we had to creat a contract agreement to set up our rules.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    We then got together for brainstorming sessions where we worked as a team to define our brand
                    identity. Each of us pitched in with logo ideas. I did a lot of research on logos with the letter
                    "S" to contribute to our designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After gathering feedback from Luuk, he said we should have a bigger collection of logos to choose
                    from and we should keep iterating. After that, I created over 10 different logos and showed them to
                    Luuk. He liked the idea behind some of the logos. We kept improving our designs until we found one
                    we all liked. Danya created a logo that we all agreed on, and I made some changes based on what our
                    classmates liked. They preferred a fan-like logo, so I made some tweaks and finalized the design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the logo design phase, our focus shifted to defining our brand identity. We collectively
                    agreed that our brand should be represented by the color purple and determined the services we would
                    offer, showcasing our ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products (LO1). I took
                    the lead in creating visual representations of our branding, iterating three times to achieve the
                    desired balance between professionalism and playfulness, thereby demonstrating my commitment to
                    creative iterations (LO3). Initially, feedback from the teacher indicated that the first version was
                    too professional, prompting us to make adjustments for the second iteration, which received positive
                    feedback but required further refinement. After further refinement, I sought feedback from Pim, who
                    noted that my design for the group mixed professionalism with a playful vibe and suggested that it might be
                    better
                    to stick to one theme. Reflecting on the visuals, I recognized the need for a balance and created a
                    third iteration, aligning our branding choices with stakeholder preferences and professional
                    standards
                    (LO4).

                    I was also involved in the creation of our group website's prototype. I began by creating
                    wireframes to illustrate how I wanted our website to appear. The wireframe served as a guide for
                    the placement of buttons and text. We aimed for a gamified, tech-oriented website, which we
                    implemented in the high-fidelity prototype.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    The process of brainstorming, designing, and iterating on our logos and brand identity was a
                    valuable
                    learning experience. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and
                    demonstrated
                    my proficiency in several learning outcomes. You can check out the different versions we went

                    The iterations of our brand identity designs highlighted the importance of continuous feedback and
                    improvement. This
                    iterative process ensured that our final design was well-received by our peers and aligned with our
                    branding goals.

                <h1 class="stroke-text">PROJECT</h1>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project for the semester involved creating a personalized nutrition plan for users utilizing
                    generative AI. Our client, Livewall, is deeply immersed in the world of generative AI, presenting an
                    excellent opportunity for me to enhance my skills in this domain.
                </p>

                <h2>Research and Brainstorming</h2>
                <p>
                    Using the double diamond method, I initiated the project by conducting primary research on user
                    preferences in nutrition apps or websites and formulated a survey based on the findings. I also
                    utilized the Lotus Framework as a brainstorming tool. I placed various words related to the main
                    goal of creating a nutrition plan and branched out from there. This framework was crucial for us
                    because it enabled us to explore the realm of nutrition plans more comprehensively and delve deeper
                    into the subject. Our research indicated that users primarily seek nutrition plans to maintain their
                    health or achieve weight loss goals.
                </p>

                <h2>Survey Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I refined the survey and targeted it towards our client's demographic, which comprises middle-aged
                    individuals. Following this, I solicited feedback from Penny, who suggested improvements to the
                    survey. These included incorporating an introductory section to clarify the concept of a nutrition
                    plan for users and integrating a question addressing their personal preferences, such as weight loss
                    or muscle gain. I then implemented her feedback and showed her the improvements, and she said the
                    questions were good. You can see the <a href="documents/survey findings.pdf"
                        target="_blank">results</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Concept Document and POV/HMW</h2>
                <p>
                    After multiple iterations of the survey, I created a <a href="documents/Concept Document.pdf"
                        target="_blank">concept document</a> to serve as a guide for the primary and secondary research.
                    I was in charge of creating the POV/HMW to view the product and users from different perspectives. I
                    asked for feedback from Penny, and she liked the fact that I had a lot of scenarios in the HMW
                    section.
                </p>

                <h2>Interview Process</h2>
                <p>
                    I created interview questions to gain more quality and useful insights. After asking for feedback
                    from a semester 2 teacher, he suggested splitting the questions for clarity and organization. This
                    would make it easier when asking a certain line of questions to the user, so follow-up questions
                    would have more context. Reflecting on the feedback, I decided to split the questions into two
                    sections. You can find the interview questions and transcript <a
                        href="documents/Interview questions .pdf">here</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Prototype Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I created the low-fidelity prototype for the nutrition plan on my own to provide a different
                    variation of the one we created together. You can find the prototype <a

                    In this project, I demonstrated proficiency in several learning outcomes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LO1:</strong> I created a low-fi prototype, used the double diamond method, created the
                        concept document, and formulated interview questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>LO3:</strong> I iterated and improved the survey and interview based on the feedback I
                        received from the teachers.</li>
                    <li><strong>LO4:</strong> I conducted research to learn more about other nutrition apps and websites
                        and their components through the double diamond research tool and the Lotus Framework.</li>
                    <li><strong>LO5:</strong> I created my own version of the low-fidelity prototype to give my group
                        different options.</li>
                </ul>
                 During the course of the project I learnt a lot about frameworks and how to use them

                <h2>Mid-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    We started the mid-fidelity prototyping phase, and I suggested creating a mobile version. I was
                    tasked with this, and despite some initial disagreements about design choices and the limited number
                    of questions to ask users, I proceeded. During the prototype creation, I identified a usability
                    problem: the question section lacked back and next buttons, causing users to automatically move to
                    the next page without the ability to go back. I informed my teammates about this issue and fixed it.

                <h2>Feedback and Iterations</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing the prototype, I received feedback from Penny. She advised me to consider the
                    branding for the nutrition plan app and not just use Livewall's image. She also pointed out that
                    people often don't have time to cook for breakfast, which I took into account, remembering that the
                    plan would be generated by AI and my version was a placeholder. You can view the prototype <a

                <h2>Applying Figma Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    For this prototype, I applied the knowledge from the Figma tutorial I took, ensuring a smooth layout
                    through the use of gridlines. After the first phase, I decided to conduct user testing before
                    continuing the prototyping phase. I asked Penny and my classmates to try the app. They suggested
                    that branding the nutrition plan with its own identity, rather than using Livewall's logo, would be
                    better. They also noted some usability issues: Penny thought using 'START' as a button to enter the
                    plan was a bad idea, and green was a poor choice for the button color. Lars suggested having a
                    visible scrollbar would be useful.
                </p>

                <h2>Improvements Based on Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Taking their feedback into account, I made changes to the branding, button color, and text within
                    the button on the "Mid-fid prototype 2nd iteration" page. I then started working on the nutrition
                    plan page. Although we had a design plan, I felt it was not good enough. Instead of making
                    large-scale changes, I made small adjustments that improved the appearance of the nutrition plan,
                    such as adding borders around each day's plan. After receiving feedback from another student, who
                    found my version easier on the eyes and suggested adding dates to each week for tracking progress, I
                    implemented these changes.After making the change to the border , my teammates disagreed with the use of the borders and decided to go on without them .
                    The next step was to create the website after the mid-fidelity prototype and I started off by creating the page for the plan itself and the layout for the pages 
                    .After creating the main nutrition plan page , I made the design responsive making the waves appear like as if they're in motion by applying transitioning colour changes and after that
                    I asked for feedback from my peers and they said it'll be better for the user if the timing between the colour changes were longer so that the users don't get distracted by them
                    and so I implemented this . After this phase , I asked the client for a meeting to see our progress and he was a bit dissapointed about the fact that he didnt have much involvement
                    in the earlier stages of the project  he noted that he wasn't carried along ,and that he expected us to carry him along and not just work alone after him giving us a 15 minute presentation  ...My mistake was not being proactive in these things and expecting the leader of the group to take care of communcication with the client as agreed in the contract .. 
                    although he was impressed with the amount of effort we put into the research he told us too find a connection between the research and our decisions in the project .
                    
                
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion and Reflection</h2>
                <p> 
                    A couple of days leading up to the deadline , I applied a lot of the technical feedback that we got from Bas(our client) including adding a reminder button 
                    to the prototype even though it's not in the final version , I also spaced out the text on the main plan page like he told me to .. showing my proficiency in 
                    learning outcome 3 by using feedback to come up with another iteration .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created an advice report that contains a summary of the project and what i'd do differently ,  find the report <a href="documents/ADVICE REPORT.pdf" target="blank">here</a>

                <p>
                    The day finally came and it was an eventful presentation because we had a lot of constructive feedback from both the teachers and the client and it felt 
                    like this day was destined to come because in the first few weeks of the semester only two people actually actively worked on the 
                    research phase in the project and it hindered the project a lot .The first feedback we got was that we didn't really involve the client which we already knew 
                    , we also got feedback that the data from the API we had used wasn't verifiable . We also got feedback that the front end was poor which I also 
                    expected and warned my teammates about early in the prototyping phase , but they refused to go with my design because they wanted something 'simple'..

                    Throughout this semester, our group prioritized utilizing GitLab as it's a mandatory tool. After
                    forming our group, our first task was to establish our repository on GitLab. We meticulously
                    organized our workflow by creating individual branches for each member, facilitating efficient
                    collaboration and version control (LO2). Our Git repository can be accessed <a
                        href="https://git.fhict.nl/I461683/triple-s-work.git" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    In addition to GitLab, we utilized Discord and WhatsApp for communication and Trello for task
                    organization, demonstrating our ability to employ transferable production tools effectively. On a
                    personal level, I set up my personal Git repository to store my work for my portfolio, ensuring to
                    comment my code according to best practices (LO2). My repository can be found <a
                        href="https://git.fhict.nl/I510304/ibhpra.git" target="_blank">here</a>..

                    We also created a way to work together and give each other tasks daily or weekly depending on how we
                    wanted to go about it and we used trello and mirrorboard to colaborate
