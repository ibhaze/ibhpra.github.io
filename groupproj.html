                <h1 class="stroke-text">INTRO WEEK</h2>
                    <p>

                        During the introductory week of the 3rd semester, our group had a fun task: designing personal
                        business cards. It was a chance to get creative and show off our design skills.

                        For me, this project was more than just making a card with my details. It was about learning and
                        showing what I could do.

                        I started with a simple design in blue and white. It had my name, logo, and contact info. After
                        that, I asked for feedback from a teacher in semester 2, and he said I should make it represent
                        me. So, I started working on a different design with a black background. This design also
                        includes a bookmark icon.

                        I chose black, grey, and gold as my personal brand colors because they reflect my personality
                        and style. Black represents sophistication and elegance, while grey symbolizes professionalism
                        and neutrality. Gold signifies luxury and prestige. Together, these colors convey a sense of
                        sophistication and professionalism that aligns with my personal brand.

                        As for the bookmark icon, I incorporated it into the design to symbolize my commitment to
                        organization and efficiency. Just as a bookmark helps keep things organized in a book, I strive
                        to keep my work and projects well-structured and easily accessible. Therefore, the bookmark icon
                        serves as a visual representation of this aspect of my personality and work ethic.

                        But I didn't stop there. I wanted to make my card look fancy, so I tried adding black and gold.
                        This
                        showed I could make interactive things, which shows proficiency in Learning Outcome 1.
                        In the end, my business card wasn't just a piece of paper. It was a way to show who I am as a
                        designer and what I've learned. <a href="documents/business card.pdf" target="_blank">see

                <h1 class="stroke-text">TRIPLE-S</h1>
                <p>

                    During our group formation, we decided to call ourselves TRIPLE-S. This name represented us as
                    third-semester students and highlighted our focus on strategic research, quick development, and cool
                    designs. To start off, we created a contract agreement to set up our rules.

                    We then got together for brainstorming sessions where we worked as a team to define our brand
                    identity. Each of us pitched in with logo ideas. I did a lot of research on logos with the letter
                    "S" to contribute to our designs.

                    After gathering feedback from Luuk, he said we should have a bigger collection of logos to choose
                    from and we should keep iterating. After that, I created over 10 different logos and showed them to
                    Luuk. He liked the idea behind some of the logos. We kept improving our designs until we found one
                    we all liked. Danya created a logo that we all agreed on, and we made some changes based on what our
                    classmates liked. They preferred a fan-like logo, so we made some tweaks and finalized our design.

                    Following the logo design phase, our focus shifted to defining our brand identity. We collectively
                    agreed that our brand should be represented by the color purple and determined the services we would
                    offer, showcasing our ability to conceptualize and develop interactive media products (LO1). I took
                    the lead in creating visual representations of our branding, iterating three times to achieve the
                    desired balance between professionalism and playfulness, thereby demonstrating my commitment to
                    creative iterations (LO3). Initially, feedback from the teacher indicated that the first version was
                    too professional, prompting us to
                    adjustments for the second iteration, which received positive feedback but required further
                    refinement and after refinement we went back for feedback with Pim and he said our design was mixing
                    professionalism with a bit of a playful vibe and he said that wasn't a bad thing but he felt it'll be
                    better
                    to stick to one theme . Reflecting on the visuals, I recognized the need for a balance and created a
                    third
                    iteration, aligning our branding choices with stakeholder preferences and professional standards
                    (LO4).You

                    I was also involved in the creation of our group website's prototype. I began by creating

                    the placement of buttons and text. We aimed for a gamified, tech-oriented website, which we
                    implemented in the high-fidelity prototype. Find the prototype <a

                <P>
                    Our project for the semester involved creating a personalized nutrition plan for users utilizing
                    generative
                    AI. Our client, Livewall, is deeply immersed in the world of generative AI, presenting an excellent
                    opportunity for me to enhance my skills in this domain. Using the double diamond method We initiated
                    the project by conducting primary research on
                    user preferences in nutrition apps or websites and formulated a survey based on the findings. We
                    also utilized the Lotus Framework as a brainstorming tool. I placed various words related to the
                    main goal of creating a nutrition plan and branched out from there. This framework was crucial for
                    us because it enabled us to explore the realm of nutrition plans more comprehensively and delve
                    deeper into the subject.. Our research
                    indicated that users primarily seek nutrition plans to maintain their health or achieve weight loss
                    goals. Subsequently, I refined the survey and targeted it towards our
                    client's demographic, which comprises middle-aged individuals. Following this, I solicited feedback
                    from Penny , who suggested improvements to the survey. These included incorporating an
                    introductory section to clarify the concept of a nutrition plan for users and integrating a question
                    addressing their personal preferences, such as weight loss or muscle gain. I then implemented her feedback and showed her the improvements and she said the questions were good .
                    .These are the <a href="documents/survey findings.pdf" target="_blank">results</a> . After multiple
                    iterations of the survey , I created a <a href="documents/Concept Document.pdf"
                        target="_blank">concept document</a> to serve as a guide for the
                    primary and secondary research , and I was again in charge of creating the POV /HMV to kind of serve
                    as
                    a way of viewing the product and users from a different perspective , then I asked from feedback from pennny and she liked the fact that I had a lot of scenarios in the HMW section. After this , I created
                    interview questions to have more quality and useful insights , I refined the
                    interview
                    questions after asking for feedback from a semester 2 Teacher and he said it'll be great to split the questions for clarity and organization of the questions and 
                    so that it'll be easier when asking a certain line
                    of questions to the user so that follow up questions will have more context . .From the feedback I reflected and decided to split the
                    questions into two sections ..You can find the interview questions and transcript <a
                        href="documents/Interview questions .pdf">here</a>. I also created the low fidelity prototype
                    for the nutrition plan
                    on my own so that we'd have a diffferent variation of the one we created together

                <p>
                    We started the mid-fidelity prototyping phase, and I suggested that we create a mobile version. I
                    was handed the task of creating that, and so I did, although from the start,
                    I didn't agree with a lot of design choices and the fact that we had such a little number of
                    questions to ask the users. During the creation of our prototype, I noticed a usability problem:
                    in the question section, there was no back or next button. So, if a user clicked an answer, it would
                    automatically take the user to the next page, and the user wouldn't be able to go back.
                    After I noticed the problem, I told my teammates, and I fixed it. After I created my prototype, I
                    got feedback from Penny and she said that I should think of the branding for the nutrition plan
                    app and not just use Livewall's image , she also said that I should take the fact that people don't
                    really have time to cook for breakfast into account and after thinking about it for a bit I
                    remembered that the plan was going to be created by AI and the one I had was just a makeshift and so
                    I informed her.  View the prototype <a

                    prototype I applied the knowledge I got from the figma tutorial I took and I made sure that the
                    layout was smooth through the use of gridlines. After the first phase , I decided to do some user testing before continuing the prototyping phase and I asked Penny to try to 
                    use the app, I also asked my classmates to try to use the app and both of them said that having the brand of the nutrition plan will be better than having 
                    livewall's logo and brand on the website they also went through some usability issues , Penny thought that using 'START' as button to get the user into the plan was a bad idea and that 
                    using green was a poor choice for the button , also Lars thought that having a visible scrollbar will be useful . Taking into account their feedback , I made changes to the branding and the colour of the button , as well as the text within the button

                <p>Throughout this semester, our group prioritized utilizing GitLab as it's a mandatory tool. After
                    forming our group, our first task was to establish our repository on GitLab. We meticulously
                    organized our workflow by creating individual branches for each member, facilitating efficient
                    collaboration and version control (LO2). Our Git repository can be accessed <a

                    personal level, I set up my personal Git repository to store my work for my portfolio, ensuring to
                    comment my code according to best practices (LO2). My repository can be found <a
                        href="https://git.fhict.nl/I510304/ibhpra.git" target="_blank">here</a>..

                    We also created a way to work together and give each other tasks daily or weekly depending on how we
                    wanted to go about it and we used trello and mirrorboard to colaborate
