                <h2>LOGO</h2>
                <p>
                    Making this logo was a fascinating journey, especially since I wasn't familiar with Adobe
                    Illustrator at first.
                    I explored different tools like the eraser, pen, reflect tool, and more, learning how they work as I
                    went along.
                    Check out the Adobe illustrator file here to see every step that was taken in the creation of the
                    logo <a href="docs/praise (1).ai">here</a>

                <h2>Logo Design Iterative Process</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Conceptualization:</h3>
                        <p>Firstly , I thought hard about what I wanted to do and I decided I wanted to incorporate the
                            first letter of my surname and first name.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Color Exploration:</h3>
                        <p>I then thought abut what colors I wanted to use , I chose an orange-like hue for the crown
                            atop the 'I' symbolizing aspirations for excellence.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Typeface Selection:</h3>
                        <p>I Opted for the Algerian font for the text in the logo, and I chose it for its vintage style
                            adding sophistication and timelessness.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Iterations:</h3>
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Initial Concepts:</strong> I began with rough sketches exploring different
                                    'IP'arrangements and styles , and after about 10 sketches ,I decided to incorporate
                                    a crown to replace the dot atop the 'I'</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> I decided to seek feedback from my peers, and I
                                    refined the concept based on their insights, leading to a more polished design.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Color Trials:</strong> I then Experimented with various color schemes and
                                    ended up with the orange crown for vibrancy and significance, but for the letters I
                                    wanted to stick with black because every other color i tried looked weird</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Refinement:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Typography Tweaks:</strong> I tried different fonts to before i was finally able to
                            achieve the perfect balance between 'IP' and the chosen font.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Finalization:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Consistency Check:</strong> I Ensured visual consistency across different
                            applications and sizes.</p>

                <h2>LAYOUT PRINCIPLES</h2>
                <p>
                    We had a class about layout principles and how it is crucial for a website , after that we were
                    given an assignment to create a layout for a magazine and we had 4 different
                    magazines given to us as a sort of reference . Me and my teammates were able to come up with this
                    layout for our magazine on an A3 paper
                </p>

                <h2>MY PHOTOBOOK </h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to a visual journey through my lens, where each photograph tells a story,
                    capturing moments . This photobook is a collection of my passion for capturing the beauty of life
                    . I invite you to immerse yourself in the colors, emotions, and memories frozen in time, as we
                    explore the world together
                    through the magic of photography.. You can find my photobook <a
                        href="docs/my photobook 2nd sem.pdf">here</a> and the folder containing my
                    images <a href="docs/photobook2.zip" download="photobook2.zip">here</a>. I made sure to use the

                <h2>STORYTELLING EXERCISES</h2>
                <p>Here , we did some exercises that required us to tell a story with different cards , so that no
                    matter what order the cards are placed in , they would tell a story.</p>

                <h2>VIDEOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p>

                    For this exercise, my group initiated a brainstorming session and generated various ideas. We
                    collectively decided on creating a horror film for our short film project. Following this decision,
                    we delved into the individual script development phase, ultimately choosing to use my script. You
                    can access our script <a href="docs/MEDIA SCRIPT.pdf">here</a>. Although some tweaks were made to
                    enhance the final version, the core concept and storyline remained intact. Find the video<a href="https://youtu.be/aLpAG7TEWjU?si=zKmYTysk-ReSWRHr"> here </a>.

                    <br><br>For our third media assignment, we chose to produce a video focusing 
                    on culture shock. In this video, we explore how relocating from our 
                    respective countries to the Netherlands has impacted us. We delve into our 
                    perceptions of the differences between our home countries and the Netherlands
                    , as well as the surprising similarities we discovered. The questions related
                    to this topic can be found in the same link provided above. The video can be found<a href="https://youtu.be/vDG6JuSAlTo"> here</a>.
