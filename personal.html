                <h1 class="stroke-text">LOGO DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to challenge myself, so I started working on a different logo than
                        the one I did last semester because I felt that logo wasn't good enough. After several
                        iterations, I felt like I couldn't
                        find the right logo by just using letters. So, I decided to go a little
                        deeper. After searching for different fonts, an idea came to me: to create
                        a logo that not only includes the first letter of my personal brand
                        (Pairbiz Designs) but also incorporates a smiley face.
                        I brainstormed on the best font to use and ended up with Bauhaus 93,
                        and the idea came to life. After the first couple of iterations,
                        I asked for feedback from my peers. Many of them liked the idea,
                        but I also received constructive feedback. They suggested that I should
                        maybe make it look more like an emoji by adding the face, or at least
                        outlines of the face. That's when I incorporated the dots to draw a mental
                        image for people who see it, making it look more like a face and after that I asked for their
                        feedback again and
                        they liked the design and the thought behind it . See my approach and iterations for
                        my logo <a href="media/logo 3rd semester.ai" target="_blank">here</a>. In designing my logo I
                        conceptualize and develop the card on figma , displaying my proficiency in (LO1),
                        I had multiple iterations and feedback from my peers on each iteration and that showed my
                        proficiency in (LO3) .I feel I also displayed learning outcome 5 by taking initiative and
                        creating
                        a logo that would represent my personal brand .

                <h1 class="stroke-text">PROTOTYPE</h1>
                <p>
                    I started out my portfolio by creating a mid-fidelity prototype using Figma. I wanted to have a
                    change from last semester's prototype's color scheme, so I chose black because I wanted my portfolio
                    to be more professional, and I wanted to have a more professional look while maintaining a cool
                    aesthetic. I researched different layouts on Awwwards, and I loved a particular layout. I tweaked it
                    a bit and used it on my 'About' page. I decided to use a more common and flexible layout for other
                    pages after feedback from Josh that the layout wasn't too flexible.
                    You can
                    explore the full prototype <a
                        href="https://www.figma.com/file/JC5aBQ79yXnAsIqnbdzTrB/Semester-3-media-personal-prototypes?type=design&node-id=334%3A71&mode=design&t=1vcrjqQV3LwN0t2p-1"
                        target="_blank">here</a> .
                    I actively engaged with multiple learning outcomes while creating this prototype . I
                    conceptualized and created diverse page layouts and designs aligning with the requirements for
                    (LO1), drawing inspiration from award-winning websites and
                    iteratively refining designs based on feedback Made sure that (LO3) was met . Through meticulous
                    adjustments, such as
                    testing font sizes and improving text alignment, I adhered to professional standards, ensuring
                    flexibility and visual consistency (LO4). Additionally, the decision to maintain small icons based
                    on positive feedback reflects personal leadership, aligning design choices with core values for
                    growth and development (LO5).

                    Since the beginning of the semester, I've been actively exploring various tutorials to enhance my
                    proficiency in using Figma. I believe I've made significant progress through these resources,
                    learning more than I would have otherwise. For instance, I've gained proficiency in using the mask
                    tool, utilizing plugins within Figma, and mastering the application of components and the pen tool.
                    My commitment to professional development and adherence to professional standards displays my
                    proficiency in learning outcome 5

                    I wanted to learn more about UX, so I took a short course at <a

                        target="_blank">Accenture</a>. It helped me understand how
                    important users are in the design process and taught me to always involve them, rather than just
                    relying on my own opinions, like thinking a color looks good or making critical design choices without user input .
                    My commitment to professional development and adherence to professional standards displays my
                    proficiency in learning outcome 5 . Through taking this course , I took steps to make sure that my future as a
                    designer is as well-rounded as possible.

                    able to take initiative and work on this interview which will help my practical application of the
                    knowledge given by the teachers . We also had a couple of iterations working with slightly different

                    showing my proficiency in learning outcome 3 due to iteration on the concept and Learning outvome 5 because of the intiative taking to facilitate personal development

                    After we got introduced to blender by Josh , I felt like I was still a bit behind so I decided to

                     simple models 
                    .This aligns with learning outcome 5 because I was able to make a decision that would impact my

                    I found a couple of tasks to be a bit challenging, so I did some research before proceeding to see
                    how the different interfaces for the tasks looked. However, I didn't start with the low-fidelity
                    prototype because I would have exceeded the time limit I set. Still, I made sure to do some
                    research.
                    . I met LO1 by developing and creating different products , LO4 by conducting research on the products i worked on and L05 by
                    making decisions that will help me learn more and develop

                <p>During the semester, I've been getting better at design—a thing I struggled with before. I started by
                    watching Blender tutorials on YouTube for 3D design. Also, I joined design challenges on Daily UI,
                    which helped a lot.

                    This change from not being good at design to being quite good at it shows how I'm growing
                    personally. I know where I'm not strong, and I'm doing things to get better. This isn't just about
                    getting better with computers but also about becoming a better leader in my own life.

                    Because of this progress, I've decided to focus on smart mobile design next semester. It's a sign
                    that I'm more confident in my skills and that I'm eager to keep learning and growing.

                    By looking at what I'm good at and what I'm not so good at, I'm becoming more aware of myself. I'm
                    taking charge of my own growth and trying to be the best I can be.
