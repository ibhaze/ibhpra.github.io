                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to challenge myself, so I started working on a different logo than the one I did last
                    semester because I felt that logo wasn't good enough. After several iterations ranging from
                    using just the letters of my first and last name to trying to update my former logo, I felt like
                    I couldn't find the right logo by just using letters. So, I decided to go a little deeper.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    After searching for different fonts, an idea came to me: to create a logo that not only includes
                    the first letter of my personal brand (Pairbiz Designs) but also incorporates a smiley face. I
                    brainstormed on the best font to use and ended up with Bauhaus 93, and the idea came to life.
                    The first version of my logo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the first iteration, I thought it was good enough but as I learnt earlier in the semester
                    in one of Penny's lecture "The product must be centered around the user," and in this case, I
                    wanted my logo and brand to be seen by other students, so I asked for feedback from my peers
                    (some semester 2 students). Many of them liked the idea, but I also received constructive
                    feedback. They suggested that I should maybe make it look more like an emoji by adding the face,
                    or at least outlines of the face. I felt that the feedback was accurate because my goal was to
                    make the logo have facial features so I started working on various versions of my second iteration.
                    I incorporated the dots to draw a mental image for
                    people who see it, making it look more like a face. After that, I asked for their feedback again
                    and they liked the design and the thought behind it. I still wasn't satisfied with just a black
                    and white logo, so I started looking at different textures. I found a grey background and masked
                    the image with my logo, and that's how my final iteration was created. See my approach and
                    iterations for my logo

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    In designing my logo, I conceptualized and developed the card on Figma, and by doing so, I displayed
                    my proficiency in LO1. I had multiple iterations and feedback from my peers on each iteration and
                    that showed my proficiency in LO3. I feel I also displayed learning outcome 5 by taking initiative
                    by seeing the weakness in my previous logo and creating a logo that would represent my personal
                    brand. (The final logo is displayed on the bottom left, with my first iteration on top of it).Beyond
                    visual aesthetics,
                    this process honed my understanding of branding and identity, shaping not just a logo but a deeper
                    sense of creativity

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    I started out my portfolio by creating a mid-fidelity prototype using Figma. I wanted to have a
                    change from last semester's prototype's color scheme, so I chose black because I wanted my portfolio
                    to be more professional, and I wanted to have a more professional look while maintaining a cool
                    aesthetic.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    I researched different layouts on Awwwards, and I loved a particular layout. After applying that
                    layout, I asked for
                    feedback from Josh and he said that I should think about how the layout will look when I have more
                    content. After that, I tweaked it a bit and used it only on my 'About' page because I thought that
                    the layout wouldn't
                    actually do the job I wanted it to do on a bigger scale. I decided to use a more common and flexible
                    layout for
                    other pages. You can explore the full prototype

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I actively engaged with multiple learning outcomes while creating this prototype. I conceptualized
                    and created diverse page layouts and designs aligning with the requirements for LO1, drawing
                    inspiration from award-winning websites and iteratively refining designs based on feedback, ensuring
                    LO3 was met. Through meticulous adjustments, such as testing font sizes and improving text
                    alignment, I adhered to professional standards, ensuring flexibility and visual consistency (LO4).
                    Additionally, the decision to maintain small icons based on positive feedback reflects personal
                    leadership, aligning design choices with core values for growth and development (LO5).

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning of the semester, I've been actively exploring various tutorials to enhance my
                    proficiency in using Figma. I believe I've made significant progress through these resources,
                    learning more than I would have otherwise. My goal was to understand figma and its tools on a larger
                    scale and so i took tutorials that helped me do just that
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    I went on YouTube to look for a tutorial that could help improve my design skills, and I found
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/HZuk6Wkx_Eg?si=aFYkPkcB_WX2agXm" target="_blank">this</a>. Although I'm not a total
                    beginner in Figma, this tutorial helped me a lot. It improved my understanding of how layouts work
                    and encouraged me to incorporate gridlines more often to enhance the layout of my pages. It also
                    made me realize how important having a low-fidelity prototype is. Every time I work on a prototype
                    in Figma, it helps me see that without visualizing the prototype, I'm just going to be stuck trying
                    to make decisions on my designs. Additionally, it introduced me to a website called
                    <a href="https://www.relume.io" target="_blank">relume</a> that helps me plan out how website navigation will work
                    much faster.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I felt I was able to meet learning outcome 5 because I recognized I lacked knowledge in designing
                    prototypes and acknowledged that
                    weakness, deciding the best course of action would be taking a course and that course in turn gave
                    me more knowledge. I applied what I learned in the tutorial in the mid-fidelity prototype for our
                    group prototype

                <p>
                    I really wanted to learn more about UX design because it was pretty obvious that I lacked skill in
                    that area , so I decided to take a short course at
                    <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/digital-skills-user-experience"
                        target="_blank">Accenture</a>. It turned out to be a great choice because it taught me some
                    really important things.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The course showed me that when it comes to designing things for people to use, you've got to think
                    about those people first. It's not just about making things look nice; it's about making sure they
                    work well for the people using them. I learned that I shouldn't just trust my own opinions when
                    making design choices. Instead, I need to involve the people who will actually be using what I'm
                    designing.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    By taking this course, I showed that I'm serious about getting better at what I do and that I know
                    how to follow the rules of my profession, displaying my proficiency in Learning Outcome 5.
                    Learning all this is helping me become a better designer overall. It's making me more ready for
                    whatever comes my way in my future as a UX designer.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    After Josh introduced me to Blender, I felt like I needed to catch up on some things because the
                    lessons were a bit too fast . So, I decided to watch a
                    tutorial course about Blender on
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/At9qW8ivJ4Q?si=nDxkeAji_LjxNi9O" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The tutorial really helped me learn a lot about Blender, including how to navigate the interface,
                    create basic
                    shapes, and apply textures to models. I even managed to complete a few models I previously struggled
                    with
                    following the tutorial's guidance.

                <p>
                    This aligns with learning outcome 5 because I made a decision to improve my knowledge of something
                    important for the future. Additionally, by working on exercises from class,
                    I gained a better understanding of the blender environment and how to apply what I learned
                    practically including the textures and uv mapping .

                    Throughout the process, we encountered various challenges, including technical errors from the other
                    side of the studio. Despite these setbacks, we persevered and successfully completed the interview.
                    This experience not only tested our problem-solving abilities but also demonstrated our resilience
                    and determination to overcome obstacles.

                <p>
                    In addition to navigating technical difficulties, we also engaged in several iterations, refining
                    our questions and answers along the way. This iterative process highlights my proficiency in
                    learning outcome 3, as I continuously improved upon the initial concept through experimentation and
                    feedback.

                    Overall, this interview served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical
                    knowledge in a practical setting. By taking the initiative to facilitate personal development and
                    embracing challenges head-on, I have demonstrated competency in both learning outcome 3 and learning
                    outcome 5. You can listen to the interview <a href="media/interview.wav" target="_blank"

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    This semester I wanted to take more workshops outside of my schedule so that i'd get more knowledge
                    on things I didn't understand. So I attended a couple of workshops including one on social media and
                    branding where I learnt a key lesson: it's
                    crucial to keep your brand message consistent across all social media platforms.
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The workshop taught me about creating interesting stories, keeping a consistent visual style, and
                    connecting with my
                    audience in an authentic way. We did practical exercises and had discussions that helped me
                    understand how every post, caption, and interaction affects how people see a brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop also stressed the importance of knowing our audience—what they like, how they act, and
                    what they want. It showed me the importance of making content that my followers relate to, that
                    makes them feel something, and that helps me connect with them. By using analytics, I can improve
                    my strategies, make my content better, and get real results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also attended a Three.js workshop by Maikel for semester 3's purple class, where I learned about
                    setting up my first scene, adding a camera, and incorporating objects. I also learned about
                    animating objects, lighting, and interactivity within the scene. Combined with Blender, I feel that
                    I can really develop the 3D aspect of my design skills even more.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, the workshop made me realize how important branding is in today's digital world. It gave me
                    skills and knowledge that I'm excited to use in my future projects. In my current project, I applied
                    some of the principles that the teacher
                    gave, including always getting user feedback at every stage of the project. By taking
                    on an extra workshop
                    that teaches me more things
                    about the career I have chosen (UX design), I feel that I've displayed my proficiency in learning
                    outcome 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting into Three.js, I really wanted to implement some designs into my portfolio,
                    but I didn't have enough knowledge about it and I didn't have enough time. So, I used CSS to
                    implement my idea on my homepage by creating a 3D-like model of my name and added a little animation
                    using transform and other CSS elements.

                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>My ability to utilize AI to create and generate things that I wanted accurately was lacking. I
                        felt it was necessary to improve this skill because I had many problems that could have been
                        solved easily with AI. However, I spent way too much time on them (e.g., the Node.js tutorial).
                        Therefore, I wanted more knowledge in this aspect & I wanted to delve deeper into generative AI
                        after the project with Livewall.. The best course of action was to learn through tutorials.</p>

                    <p>
                        I went on <a href="https://youtu.be/jC4v5AS4RIM?si=kTQ0UuME61jNOM3A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
                        and found a very informative tutorial. I learned to always provide context as well as examples
                        and to use words like "generate" and "analyze" while using prompts on resources like ChatGPT.
                        I also took a short
                        <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/536/video/466321"
                            target="_blank">Google</a> course.
                        It taught me how to recognize when an output is generated by AI and about AI models and LLM's.

                    <p>
                        This helped me a lot because, using the guidelines provided by the tutorial, anytime I prompt
                        ChatGPT, it always provides concise answers without straying from the initial point. I feel that
                        I met Learning Outcome 5 due to my willingness to actively improve and expand my skill set using
                        available resources.
                        The google course taught me that it's generative AI when the output is in natural language like
                        text, image, or audio,
                        but not when the output is a probability or a class. Additionally, I learned about various
                        techniques and models
                        used in generative AI, such as GPT, GANs, and VAEs. This knowledge has inspired me to explore
                        more advanced topics
                        and consider how to apply generative AI in future projects.

                <p>
                    I was already introduced to photoshop in semester 2 but I didn't have a lot of knowledge about it and I felt that it was 
                    necessary to have more knowledge about it especially because of the field I want to go into later (Ux design).

                <p>
                    I started out by searching for which tutorial will be best for a beginner on google and reddit and I found a youtube channel (<a href="https://youtu.be/xTzvQkOll2U?si=QDJ33YAtWEki4zkl" target="_blank">Piximperfect</a>) 
                    and it had an introduction to photoshop for beginners and I found out it was really great for me as it really was in-depth and It improved my skills in the software 
                   . I even woorked on a couple of projects (including the image on the right) in this project , I was tasked replacing the backround of the subject and replacing
                   it with another background and in the process I learnt to work with layers while not working destructively ...I also became familiar with the smudge tool and
                   I used it to correct some lighting errors from the new background on the subject .
                </p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I feel I have been able to meet the requirements for learning outcome 1 & 5 because I developed a couple of media products through the project and I also actively took
                    steps to ensure my goal of becoming a Ux designer is met.

                <h1 class="stroke-text">PORTFOLIO FEEDBACK</h1>
                <p>
                    In the first iteration of my portfolio the feedback I got from Joris and Amer was that I didn't show
                    the connection to the learning outcomes in my portfolio and after that feedback , I decided to add a
                    connection between things in my portfolio and every learning outcome that they meet .I also decided
                    to go a bit further visually and add icons and their meaning in each page according to Amer's advice
                    to do that . In the second feedback session ,
                    I got feedback that the loading time for my index page was way too long and the links had bad
                    colours so I removed the transition to the next page and create a button to replace that and I also
                    changed the colour of the links from the default colour to a more user friendly colour , I also got
                    feedback from josh that I need to create a portfolio abstract that will give an overview of what
                    will be shown in the portfolio so I did that and he also said I should think iabout creating an
                    explanation to the icons that they were too vague and he had no idea what they meant , so I placed a
                    key(explanation) of what learning outcome each icon represented on every page. I didnt agree with a
                    part of Josh's feedback about having a page for each learning outcome because I felt that I had way
                    too many learning outcomes on each project to do that so I just kept my page structure. After some
                    weeks,
                    I asked for feedback from Amer on the structure of my portfolio and how the connection that I made
                    to the learning outcomes was,
                    and he liked the way I was able to connect the learning outcomes and tell a story.I also went to
                    another semester 3 teacher to ask for feedback on my
                    portfolio's structure after asking Amer and the teacher suggested that I add subsections to my
                    portfolio so that I'll have better readability and so I took his advice
                    and I split each section into 3 subsections(Goal, process, reflection) and I noticed that my
                    portfolio became more readable .
                    After this , I went back to ask for feedback from Amer and he said it would be nice if my scrollbar was visible and if I had the learning outcome under each icon
                    so I did that and customized the scrollbar a bit .
                     My willingness to
                    ask for feedback and make improvements
                    after that shows my proficiency in learning outcome 3.

                <p>
                    Throughout the semester, I've learned a lot and grown a ton, especially in design. At first, design
                    was really tough for me, but I worked hard and got a lot better. I watched a bunch of tutorials on
                    Blender for 3D design and did design challenges on Daily UI. These things helped me get better at
                    the technical stuff and feel more sure of myself.

                    One big help was Penny's lectures. She taught me a lot about design principles and how to use them
                    in real life. Before her lectures, I didn't know much about some parts of user-centered design, but
                    she really
                    helped me out. Her lectures made me want to learn even more about design..A vital lesson was the one
                    about persuasive design , she taught me about the dark side of user-centered
                    design and how big companies use certain dark techniques to keep their users attached to their
                    products . At the same time, I've
                    been working on my weak points and trying to be a better leader in my personal life.

                    All this work has changed how I see design. It used to be hard for me, but now I feel like it's
                    something I'm good at. This journey has taught me a lot about myself and how to keep getting better.
                    I've realized that it's not just about getting better at using computers, but also about growing as
                    a person.

                    I also started to look at some job vacancies in Ux design on different platforms like linkedin and their requirements and I found out that all of them 
                    required proficiency in figma or adobe xd & I decided to improve my knowledge in Figma through tutorials because of this .

                    I listened in on one workshop at the IT festival, and during the audio workshop, I realized that I wanted nothing to do with that field. Maybe it was just because I knew nothing about it because everything sounded complex.

                    Because of all this progress, I've decided to focus on smart mobile design next semester. I feel
                    more confident in my skills now, and I'm excited to keep learning and improving. By knowing what I'm
                    good at and what I need to work on, I'm taking control of my own growth and trying to be the best I
                    can be.
